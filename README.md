# fifth project on Speech Synthesis
plans to come up with a full high quality text to speech system for the kikuyu language
currently doing well in the development of Kiwsahili unit selection voice based on python modules pydub and pyaudio.
pyaudio works best in python 2.7.6-- apparently the most likely python for you if you have a python 

make sure you have the correct pip and have the right environment variables
am using ubuntu linux but the project should be portable.
